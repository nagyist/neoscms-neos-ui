 * Contract to hook into the process before the node creation command is handled by the content repository

 * You can add additional steps to the node creation.
 * For example adding initial properties via {@see NodeCreationCommands::withInitialPropertyValues()},
 * or queuing additional commands like to create a child via {@see NodeCreationCommands::withAdditionalCommands()}
 *
 * The node creation handlers factory can be registered on a NodeType:
 *
 *     Vendor.Site:Content:
 *       options:
 *         nodeCreationHandlers:
 *           myHandler:
 *             factoryClassName: 'Vendor\Site\MyHandlerFactory'
 *             position: end
 *
 * The factory must implement the {@see NodeCreationHandlerFactoryInterface} and
 * return an implementation with this {@see NodeCreationHandlerInterface} interface.
 *
 * The current content-repository or NodeType-manager will be accessible via the
 * content repository in {@see NodeCreationHandlerFactoryInterface::build()}.
